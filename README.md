## Time at Home

Time at Home is a little app that comes with two widgets (system-small and system-medium) which shows the current time and date at your home timezone and your current timezone. If you are on travel and would quickly check the what time it is at home and if you are ahead or behind your home time, you can see this on the widget.

The app looks as follows:
![App](https://github.com/HanSolo/Time-At-Home/raw/main/screenshots/iPhone 6.9" Display - Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max 6.9-inch - Screenshot1.png)

1. Simply select your home timezone e.g. Asia/Singapore

2. Give your home timezone a name e.g. Singapore

3. Select if you would like to use 24 h or 12 h time format

At the bottom you see a preview of the system-medium widget so that you can get an idea what to expect.

The widgets:

On the widget you can see the home timezone (left side) and the current timezone (right side). On this screenshot, your home timezone is Singapore and you are currently in Berlin, Germany. 
You can see the current date and day of week directly below the name of the city.
And as you can see in Singapore it's 8:11pm and it is already night time (only a subtle frame and a moon icon) where in Berlin it is 2:11pm and it is still day time (slightly brighter background and a little sun icon).
You can also see that the different timezone abbreviations e.g. GMT+8 for Singapore and CEST for Berlin. If there is daylight saving time "active" in one of the timezones you will also find a "(DST)" at the end of this row.
In the last row you can see if you are ahead or behind of your home timezone, on this screenshot we are in Berlin 6 hours behind Singapore.
